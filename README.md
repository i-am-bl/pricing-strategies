## Introduction

### Purpose

It is intended to share my experience as a price strategy owner. Discussion points will include responsibilities, obstacles, solutions, and lessons learned.

### What is Pricing Strategy?

A pricing strategy is the plan or approach a company uses to set the price of its products or services. Setting a price point is difficult. This requires an analysis that considers multiple factors. Not all industries have good data to analyze, leading to a guessing game.

- **Cost-plus pricing**:\
  The price strategy for a product or service is determined by adding a markup percentage to the cost of producing the product. This pricing strategy is commonly used in the manufacturing industry.
- **Penetration pricing**:\
  The product or service is initially offered to the market at a lower price. It is intended to gain market share by offering a more attractive price than competitors. This is most often used by new entrants to the market.
- **Skimming pricing**:\
  The product or service is initially offered at a premium price. Early adopters are sometimes willing to pay more for the product or service. It is intended to quickly recoup high R&D costs. Prices are often lowered to gain a higher adoption rate after its initial offering.
- **Dynamic pricing**:\
  The price strategy for a product or service is fluid with market conditions and is updated often to optimize revenue. It is intended to align with market conditions to make the product or service more attractive. This pricing strategy is commonly used in the hospitality industry.
- **Bundle pricing**:\
  Price strategy offers products or services to the market as a package at a discounted price. It is intended to persuade customers to purchase more products or services, effectively increasing revenue and sales.
- **Value-based pricing**:\
  Market price is determined by the value perceived by the customer. Strategy is best for software products that have high input costs. Value can be understood as an increase in revenue or cost-savings for the customer. Setting this price point can be difficult.
- **Good-Better-Best (G-B-B)**:\
  The pricing strategy consists of creating a three price bands or tiers for products or services. Each tier offers better features than the one below it. This encourages consumers to upgrade to a better tier.
- **Promotional pricing**:\
  This is a marketing strategy that advertises the product or service at a deflated price for a limited period. It is intended to attract customers to increase sales.

## Software Products

Table below is a quick summary of software products in which I managed pricing strategies.

| Product                                                          | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏷️ [Enterprise Banking Software](#️-enterprise-banking-software) | Software consisted of many modules to effectively manage the loan lifecycle.                |
| 🏷️ [Loan Application Software](#loan-application-software)       | Application software was a data collection tool to streamline the loan application process. |

### 🏷️ Enterprise Banking Software

This multi-module application enabled FIs (Financial Institutions) to effectively manage the loan lifecycle. Solution included software enabled services for FIs to offload services if needed.

> **Example**: Platform featured items like application management, credit management, document processing, tickler & exceptions, etc.

💸 **Pricing Strategy:** Value Based Pricing, Good-Better-Best (G-B-B)

💲 **Pricing Model**

| Tier   | Pricing | Description            |
| ------ | ------- | ---------------------- |
| Tier 1 | $       | Services only.         |
| Tier 2 | $$      | Software and services. |
| Tier 3 | $$$     | Software only.         |

The company began as a servicer. As we transitioned into the FinTech space, we were a disruptor by offering software and services.

To strategically couple software with services, a three-tier model was constructed. This pricing strategy combined value-based pricing and G-B-B.

If clients simply wanted software-enabled services, they required less features. Tier 1 satisfied this need by offering a more economic friendly price. The primary goal was to encourage clients to sign up for some services. Some clients were hesitant about offloading their work to a third party. This model encouraged clients to try our services. Service engagement started small and slowly grew with time. It was an effective hook. The company was focused on the customer experience; without this focus, the hook would not have been as effective.

🚀 **Outcome**:

This industry, commercial lending, was highly secretive. Competitive price points were impossible to know. This model was unique at the time. Competitors did one or the other, services or software. To finalize our strategy for launch, it required a lot of refinement.

Earlier ideas were a little more complex. We were attempting to set price points that offered fair pricing for the size of the FI. This was very difficult when clients ranged from $250MM - $4B in assets. With the added complexity to this three-tiered model, it became more difficult to explain, even when it seemed simple. Sales would take notes but returned the next day with follow-up questions. We realized that if sales representitives could not walk away after 30 seconds with the confidence to explain it, they could not sell it.

While we tried our best to create a model with variable pricing through deep analytics and projections, it simply complicated things. The outcome resulted in keeping it simple with some room to negotiate. The model matured as we got into the market. Talking with prospective clients, we were able to learn what we needed to adjust.

🚀 **Lessons Learned**:

This was an exceptional experience for me. Most product leaders join mature organizations. With established pricing, they have little opportunity if any to own the product pricing strategy. Their primary focus is solving customer problems by working with design and engineering. Their go-to-market strategies are more often continuous delivery in two week or less intervals.

I did not do this alone. I had an amazing mentor who led me. My background was very analytical in nature. This was one of the first problems encountered that I could not justify with projections. This highly secretive industry, which gave no insight into price points presented a significant challenge. I learned the importance of knowing when to lean on others. In this situation we had to lean on the reaction of sales and other team members to hedge our bets.

In conclusion, undertaking something new presents significant challenges. If it was easy, everybody would do it. It is okay to adjust, you just must get started.

### Loan Application Software

This application facilitated the online commercial loan application process. It included self-sign-up, application submission, secure file transfer, and the ability to onboard existing clients of the FI.

💸 **Pricing Strategy:** Penetration Pricing

There were very few competitors in the market that offered a solution for the commercial loan application process. There were several solutions for credit cards or mortgage applications.

We were a little late to market with our solution. The vision overshot the customer’s need and took us longer to enter the market. The pricing strategy primarily used penetration pricing to gain market share. This consisted of one price.

🚀 **Outcome**:

This industry, commercial lending, was highly secretive. Competitive price points and product functionality were impossible to know. The application contained bugs and was challenging to navigate. The best pricing information was our own from our much larger application. We established the best possible price point possible with the information available. The strategy was simple, to gain market share. A pre-sale strategy offered a limited period of free use if the client participated in the early adoption period. This was limited to clients that were signing up for our other product. It was not widely marketed.

Adoption was slow but this was not unique for the industry. Sales cycles averaged 12-18 months. The strategy was effective, we were able to gain some market share with a product that needed some work.

We knew enough to pick our pricing strategy; the price point was the obstacle.

🚀 **Lessons Learned**:

This was an exceptional experience for me. The highly secretive industry gave no insight into what a reasonable price point was. I attempted to research other industries to find a comparable; I had no luck. We could not lean on the industry experts; nobody had any experience with a similar product. My background was analytical in nature, and justifications came naturally. This was simply a guess.

In conclusion, I learned not all situations are quantifiable. Time creates data. Sometimes a best guess is the best rationale answer.

## Lending Services

| SBA & USDA Loan Underwriting   | Actibities include financial analysis, Etran submission, and underwriting for government guaranteed programs.                    |

💸 **Pricing Strategy:** Various

💲 **Pricing Model**

| Model                | Description                                                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owner Pricing        | Owners discounts                                                           |
| Subscriber Pricing   | List price                                                                 |
| Basis Points Pricing | Service discounts combined with monthly fees based on loan portfolio size. |

The pricing strategy for the service model consisted of multiple variations. At a high-level, they all can be categorized in the above models.

The lending industry was very secretive, and competitor price points were difficult to know. Sometimes a proposal from a competitor could be obtained by a secret shopper. It was also difficult to know the quality of the service compared to competitors. How deep was the analysis, what was the length of their report, etc.

🚀 **Outcome**:

There were over 250 services listed in our catalog. In the first year, we retired over 100 services, focusing business units. Departments wasted time doing little things that were not profitable that had little demand. There was an approximate increase of 7-10% in output for services that had higher demand in a declining economy.

Prices had not changed in a decade for any services. The economy has changed drastically in a decade, and I felt that was a signal that a price increase was overdue. This was difficult to do with no information other than clients were happy with the current pricing.

As the economy began to decline, multiple industries were making significant price increases. We felt that this was an opportunity to gracefully shift our prices without disrupting revenue streams.

This required input from department heads, cost-analysis, and projections. The first year, we made very significant price increases on key services. Some increases were as much as 50%. We soon learned that these price increases made little splash. This indicated we were well below market value. The next year we did a blanket increase which was comparable with the behavior of several other industries.

Revenue was effectively increased by a substantial amount. Little to no business was lost because of our price increases. This was a huge success.

Obviously, incremental price increases can bring diminishing returns at some point. However, as the economy changes, it is important to understand the value of products or services.

Following the setting of price points that fit market conditions, we established a strategy for bundling. One of the biggest obstacles for the company was projecting production. They over hired and under hired. All the risk was on the company. To mitigate this risk, bundling offered a pre-pay plan for services at a discount. This incentivized clients to give insight into what they were projecting for their market, effectively offloading company risk.

This was a success. Bundles could be bought quarterly, and services were simply charged at full price once the bundle was exhausted.

🚀 **Lessons Learned**:

This was an exceptional experience. I learned how to effectively sell an idea. I had experience selling an idea to management for features and product improvements, but those ideas had less risk. This idea was much harder to sell to a company that had not ever increased their prices, and these prices were locked-in for 12 months.

I also had the privilege to work through CRM migrations and played a more active role in CRM management than previous roles. Prior to me leading pricing strategy, we had little process to manage pricing variations. Things were missed and accidents happened often. I played a pivotal role in mitigating this risk. This required hands-on management with order management functions and required me to work with accounting, business units, and customer success. I had experience working with cross-functional teams prior, but this mostly consisted of design and engineering.

My background was in agriculture. Each year we projected our input costs for the coming year. We would pre-pay for some of the large input costs at discounted rates. The row crop industry had volatile market conditions, but the concept was the same. I asked multiple times about this in the lending industry and was quickly dismissed. It was not common. It was more common for a client to pay a member fee upfront each year. This was like paying a membership fee at a country club. My boss was from a different industry and the idea made perfect sense and pushed this idea across the line.

While it took somebody in a higher salary bracket to convince the team, it was amazing to have a front row seat for the transition. To effectively incentivize the client to mitigate business risk is a powerful skill.

In conclusion, leading pricing strategy for a service company equipped me with a new set of skills as a product leader. As we incentivized the client in a new way, the stress of department heads slowly faded at each fiscal year end.
